# Cyclistic Bike Share Analysis

This project analyzes 12 months of ride data from the Divvy/Cyclistic bike-share program in Chicago, comparing usage patterns between casual riders and annual members.

## Key Insights
- Members ride more often and use the bikes for commuting.
- Casual users tend to take longer, leisure-oriented rides near tourist areas.
- Hourly, daily, and spatial patterns are visualized with interactive maps and charts.
